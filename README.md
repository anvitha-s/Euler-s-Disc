# Euler-s-Disc
MATLAB simulation of the motion of an Euler's Disc
The simulations are performed on MATLAB by implementing dissipation moments and forces and formulating the equations by taking suitable assumtions(pure rolling) to get equations of motion, which could be implemented as a state space model similar to the 
one used in the animation of the ideal thin Rolling disc on [Rotations](http://rotations.berkeley.edu/the-rolling-disk/).
